## Requirements Management & Work Evaluation Desktop Application

## About Project

A desktop application which allows workers to be assigned tasks. Given task can also be monitored and evaluated 
using DFA automata concepts. [learn more about automata](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/formal-language)

## Prerequisites

You can run the application using the [ReqApp.exe](ReqApp/bin/Debug/) file. To run the source code, Visual studio with C#, .Net and
Windows Forms needs to be installed. The fontawesome library needs not be installed since the static files are already available. However
can be updated (from the Nuget Package Manager) to a new version if any update(s) is/are available
